# WCE-Curated-Colon-Disease-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
-The **WCE Curated Colon Disease Classification** is a classification system that categorizes diseases and abnormalities of the colon based on findings from wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE).

-WCE is a minimally invasive diagnostic tool that uses a small capsule with a camera to capture images of the inside of the colon as it passes through.

-The colon diseases and abnormalities that can be classified using the WCE Curated Colon Disease Classification include polyps, ulcerative colitis & esophagitis, and other pathologies. These conditions can range from benign to malignant, and their management and treatment depend on the specific diagnosis. In the context of colon disease classification, **deep learning can be used to analyze images captured by wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) and classify them into different disease categories**. This approach has shown promising results, with some studies reporting high accuracy rates for colon disease diagnosis using deep learning algorithms.

## Social Impact: 
The use of the WCE Curated colon disease classification system, coupled with deep learning algorithms, enhances the accuracy of colon disease diagnosis. This **leads to earlier detection and more precise tratment**, potentially saving lives and improving the overall health of patients.

## Business Impact: 
Academic institutions and research organizations can use the curated dataset and research findings from the WCE curated colon disease classification system **to advance knowledge in the field of colon disease**, leading to scientific publications and grants.
  
## Stack Used:
